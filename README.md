## Introduction
This is a code repository for my 30 websites in 30 days challenge. I wanted to test myself by learning code through creating actual websites. All of the websites in this challenge were built using:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

<!-- Notable Features:

-   Fully responsive custom css styling
-   Search modal that allows users to select a country to view
-   Containers that show the data of total cases, total recovered, and total deaths from COVID-19
-   Displays daily increase of cases

Featured ideas to implement:

- Ability to see the global statistics of COVID
- Dark mode function -->
